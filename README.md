# Ansible Role: Pip (for Python)

[![CI](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-pip/workflows/CI/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-pip/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

An Ansible Role that installs [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io) on Linux.

## Requirements

On RedHat/CentOS, you may need to have EPEL installed before running this role. You can use the `geerlingguy.repo-epel` role if you need a simple way to ensure it's installed.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    pip_package: python3-pip

The name of the package to install to get `pip` on the system. For older systems that don't have Python 3 available, you can set this to `python-pip`.

    pip_executable: pip3

The role will try to autodetect the pip executable based on the `pip_package` (e.g. `pip` for Python 2 and `pip3` for Python 3). You can also override this explicitly, e.g. `pip_executable: pip3.6`.

    pip_externally_managed: true

Marking whether Python base environments should be "externally managed" or not.

    pip_install_packages: []

A list of packages to install with pip. Examples below:

    pip_install_packages:
      # Specify names and versions.
      - name: docker
        version: "1.2.3"
      - name: awscli
        version: "1.11.91"
    
      # Or specify bare packages to get the latest release.
      - docker
      - awscli
    
      # Or uninstall a package.
      - name: docker
        state: absent
    
      # Or update a package to the latest version.
      - name: docker
        state: latest
    
      # Or force a reinstall.
      - name: docker
        state: forcereinstall
    
      # Or install a package in a particular virtualenv.
      - name: docker
        virtualenv: /my_app/venv

      # Or pass through any extra arguments.
      - name: my_special_package_from_my_special_repo
        extra_args: --extra-index-url https://my-domain/pypi/pypi-master/simple

## Dependencies
